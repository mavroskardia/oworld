Introduction

	Overworld is a traditional 2D RPG similar in visual style to Dragon 
	Quest, Final Fantasy, or Ultima.  The setting of Overworld is a 
	fictional post-apocalyptic world where humanity has divided into at 
	least two types of people: those inside the cities, and those outside.  

Background Story
	
	When the entire world was turned into a desolate wasteland, the few 
	remaining survivors had	to pick up the pieces and find a way to survive
	in a world that offered no favors and harbored no regrets. Shortly 
	after the Waste, the remnants of human civilization began segmenting. 
	Some formed tribes, some became scavengers, others resorted to violence
	and thievery.  
	
	Those that formed tribes pooled their resources to form basic
	communities. They guarded the resources from the ever-increasingly bold
	raiders who wanted to steal, cheat, or kill their way to a better life.
	In time, high walls, cliffsides, and dangerous chasms started to 
	surround the communities in order to keep the inhabitants safe from the
	desperation of the Barrens.  
	
	The communities, having isolated themselves from the rest of the world, 
	invented amazing technologies to remain self-sufficient and safe.  
	Communities soon became villages, villages became towns, towns became 
	cities, and eventually the cities completely encompassed the area 
	inside the walls.  Then they grew skyward.  The cities became so 
	immense that they were visible in the Barrens from hundreds of miles 
	away. A beacon to the Barren dwellers of a life long forgotten. 
	
	Those who refused to join the tribes found life in the Barrens meant 
	something entirely different than before the Waste.  The world had 
	become a living being, able to swallow a person whole on a whim.  
	Sandstorms, crazed beasts, and other Barren dwellers were just some of 
	the dangers.

	The harsh environment served as an incubator, and the constant kill or 
	be killed way of life served as the catalyst that made the inhabitants 
	of the Barrens adapt to more and more threatening situations.  By the 
	time the cities were erected, the people of the Barrens could hardly 
	remember the life lived by those inside the walls. They could hardly 
	remember and could hardly care.
